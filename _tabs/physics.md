## Work
 
I am currently a Senior Error Correction Theorist at Atom computing and the Technical Lead of the QEC team. Despite my title, I like to think of myself and my team members as QEC engineers. I spend most of my time thinking about quantum error correction, fault-tolerance, and architectures of quantum computers based on neutral atoms. I also enjoy thinking about compilation of quantum gates and algorithms, quantum applications, resource estimation, and (abstracted) neutral atom physics. In almost all of my work, I enjoy writing simulations. 

I started at Atom Computing as a member of the Applications team in 2021. In addition to some work on error correction, I also worked on developing early QCVV software, simulation of NISQ algorithms, and compiling/optimizing for Atom's native gateset. Early projects on error correction explored [dealing with atom loss](/content/correcting_atom_loss) and simulation of logical gates. I was also involved with Atom's efforts on the DARPA US2QC program.

Currently, I am working on developing Atom Computing's QEC software stack, including a Clifford simulator that incorporates leakage and loss, our decoding toolset, error budgeting, code developement utilities, and tools to map various QEC codes to our hardware. I also work on evaluation of medium- and long-term architectural candidates and fault-tolerant resource estimation. 


## Academic

In grad school (UW-Madison Physics, Advisor: Robert Joynt) I worked on several projects under the umbrella of quantum computation and information. Research topics included classical simulation of quantum noise, the [geometry of entangled states](/content/geometry_of_entangled_states), and [error correction using neutral atoms without measurement](/content/overcomplete_stabilizers). 

Following grad school I did a postdoc (Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Advisor: Anthony Leggett) where I worked closer to condensed matter physics. I wrote an exact self-consistent solver for $T_c$ in the BEC/BCS crossover regime, applicable to small "granules" of material.

## Other

For a few years between academia and industry, I taught physics at Phillips Academy in Andover, MA. The school has some remarkable students, and I particularly enjoyed teaching a quantum mechanics course that I developed. We followed *A Modern Approach to Quantum Mechanics* by Townsend. I am a firm advocate of using two-state systems and linear algebra as primary entry points into quantum mechanics. The course is appropriate for students that have completed single-variable calculus and a rigorous calculus-based physics course, but experience with multivariable calc, linear algebra, and prior experience with advanced physics courses are recommended. My course notes and problem sets are available on request.
