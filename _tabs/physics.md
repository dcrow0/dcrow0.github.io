## Work

I currently work at Atom Computing. I spend most of my time thinking about quantum error correction, fault-tolerance, and architectures of quantum computers. I also enjoy thinking about compilation of quantum gates and algorithms, quantum applications, fault-tolerant resource estimation, and neutral atom physics. In almost all of my work, I love writing simulations. 


## Academic

In grad school (UW-Madison Physics, Advisor: Robert Joynt) I worked on several projects under the umbrella of quantum computation and information. Research topics included classical simulation of quantum noise, the geometry of entangled states, and error correction using neutral atoms. 

Following grad school I did a postdoc (Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Advisor: Anthony Leggett) where I worked closer to condensed matter physics. I wrote an exact self-consistent solver for $T_c$ in the BEC/BCS crossover regime, applicable to small "granules" of material. 

## Other

For a few years between academia and industry, I taught physics at Phillips Academy in Andover, MA. The school has some remarkable students, and I particularly enjoyed teaching a quantum mechanics course that I developed. We followed *A Modern Approach to Quantum Mechanics* by Townsend. I am a firm advocate of using two-state systems and linear algebra as primary entry points into quantum mechanics. The course is appropriate for students that have completed single-variable calculus and a rigorous calculus-based physics course, but experience with multivariable calc, linear algebra, and prior experience with advanced physics courses are recommended. My course notes and problem sets are available on request.
