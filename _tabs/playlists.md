I've recently started building a series of *geographic playlists*. These started as ways to remember various places that I've lived, but have since evolved into a separate project that I've worked on with one anonymous collaborator. These playlists are not made of songs that we necessarily like or songs that necessarily go well together. I like to think of them as sociological studies. Generally, most songs will either explicitly reference the place itself, or some location within the place. But that's a slightly flexible rule. Many of these are still very in-progress.
