### About this site

This is my multi-purpose personal website. At present it's very much a work in progress. I plan to use it as a place to write about non-work related math/physics/computer stuff. I also want to use it as a central place to backup non-work things that I've worked on. In practice, this is likely to be recipes.

### About me

My name is Daniel. I work in quantum computing for [Atom Computing](https://www.atom-computing.com) where I think about math, physics, and computing.  

Outside of work I enjoy cooking, gardening, hiking, and woodworking. I have a dog named Otis; he is the best.
