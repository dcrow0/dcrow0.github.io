### About this site

This is my multi-purpose personal website. At present, it's very much a work in progress.

### About me

My name is Daniel. I work in quantum computing for [Atom Computing](www.atom-computing.com) where I think about math, physics, and computing. 

Besides quantum computing, I enjoy cooking, gardening, and hiking. I have a dog named Otis.
