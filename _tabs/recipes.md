## Chili Crisp

Here is my chili crisp recipe. 


### Ingredients

- 1/2 head of garlic
- 1 cup of neutral oil, divided
- 1/4 cup dried onion flakes
- 1 tsp sugar, divided
- 1 tsp kosher salt, divided
- 1/3 - 1/2 cup of chili flakes. (I used a mix of Sichuan peppers and Korean gochugaru, in roughly equal proportions. I kept some of the seeds from the Sichuan peppers, but discarded most of them.)
- 1/8 cup of sesame seeds
- 1/8 cup fermented black beans
- 2 tsp of Sichuan peppercorn (red)
- Soy sauce to taste
- 1/2 tsp MSG

### Steps

1. Pulverize the garlic (in a food processor). Add it to a small saucepan with 1/2 cup of the oil. Turn heat to its lowest setting and allow the garlic to cook gently for 20-30 minutes until it just starts to turn golden. If you want, now add ginger at the same time.
2. While the garlic is cooking, use a spice grinder or mortar/pestle to crush the chilis and peppercorns.
3. When the garlic is golden add the remaining oil, all of the onion flakes, half of the sugar, and half of the salt. Turn the heat to medium (or medium-low). Cook for a few minutes until the onion flakes are golden or light brown. This should take a few (~5) minutes. 
4. Add the crushed peppercorn, sesame seeds, chili flakes, black beans, and the remaining salt and sugar. Stir to coat and cook for about 1 minutes. Turn off the heat. If the oil doesn't quite cover everything, feel free to top it off. 
5. Place everything in a jar, and top with a couple of tablespoons of soy sauce. Taste and adjust salt if necessary. It should keep for a couple of months in the fridge.
