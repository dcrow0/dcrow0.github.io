I work in quantum computing and enjoy thinking about math, physics, computation, and information.  You can view my papers [on Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0kRNTVAAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra). You can learn more about my work on the [Physics](/physics) page.

Outside of work I enjoy cooking, gardening, hiking, and woodworking. I have a dog named [Otis](/otis); he is the best.
