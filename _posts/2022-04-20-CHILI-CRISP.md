I'm a big fan of adding chili crisp to my food. Over the past couple of years, I've tried most of the common brands and come to develop my own preferences about how I want my chili crisp to taste. I typically have a few different types in my fridge, but I think some are too salty, some are not salty enough, and others are somewhat bland. I finally decided to try making my own.

The initial results were very encouraging! I do think that I'll improve this recipe as I keep trying, but my initial batch was good enough that I will no longer need to keep 3 or 4 brands in my fridge---and it's cheaper.


I read a few recipes and many chili crisp labels before trying my own. In particular, this recipe is mostly a blend of the recipes [from NYT][nyt] and [Woks of Life][wol]. 

## The recipe

### Ingredients

- 1/2 head of garlic
- 1 cup of neutral oil, divided
- 1/4 cup dried onion flakes
- 1 tsp sugar, divided
- 1 tsp kosher salt, divided
- 1/3 - 1/2 cup of chili flakes. (I used a mix of Sichuan peppers and Korean gochugaru, in roughly equal proportions. I kept some of the seeds from the Sichuan peppers, but discarded most of them.)
- 1/8 cup of sesame seeds
- 1/8 cup fermented black beans
- 2 tsp of Sichuan peppercorn (red)
- Soy sauce to taste

### Steps

1. Pulverize the garlic in a food processor. Add it to a small saucepan with 1/2 cup of the oil. Turn heat to its lowest setting and allow the garlic to confit itself for 20-30 minutes until it just starts to turn golden.
2. While the garlic is cooking, use a spice grinder or mortar/pestle to crush the chilis and peppercorns.
3. When the garlic is uniformly golden, add the remaining oil, all of the onion flakes, half of the sugar, and half of the salt. Turn the heat to medium (or medium-low). Cook for a few minutes until the onion flakes are golden or light brown. This should take a few (~5) minutes. 
4. Add the crushed peppercorn, sesame seeds, chili flakes, black beans, and the remaining salt and sugar. Stir to coat and cook for about 1 minutes. Turn off the heat. If the oil doesn't quite cover everything, feel free to top it off. 
5. Place everything in a jar, and top with a couple of tablespoons of soy sauce. Taste and adjust salt if necessary. It should keep for a couple of months in the fridge. 



### Future

Possible additions/improvements:

- ginger
- shallots instead of onions
- add star anise, cloves, cinnamon, and/or fennel seeds to oil during the garlic phase to add 5-spice flavor, but remove before turning up the heat 
- sesame oil
